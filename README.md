### Graphics Programming tools

These are several small graphics programming tools that are really useful for the development of application using DirectX12, DX11 or any graphics API. I've built these throughout my years at university.

Use is free and open to all. They are multithreaded and will work across multiple threads, you can build them from source if you're concerned about security. As well as use the included binaries.

#### Currently Included

-  System Check
-  AMP
-  Data Type Sizes
